I was interested in notcoin and how to make money with it and decided to create an autobot for it, this is version 1.0
# Features

* Autoclicker that does not deduct coins for clicks 
* supports up to 1000 accounts, depending on your system
* proxy should be used if you want to mine on more than 10 accounts
* Add accounts via tdata|sms
# how to use
1. open autobot 
2. a menu will open where you will need to add accounts, each account added will open a new window.
For each window you can enable or disable automining.
You can also enable or disable automining for all windows.
